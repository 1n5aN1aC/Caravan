/**
 * Fetching things before they are wanted.
 *
 * Everything here is already bundled and content-hashed, and the server marks
 * hashed URLs `immutable` (see `server.ts`), so a warmed file stays warm across
 * reloads and matches. All this module decides is *when* to ask for each one.
 *
 * Two tiers, because the point is a head start rather than a stampede:
 *
 *   now   — the small, certain things: card backs, the deal, the room tone.
 *           Wanted within seconds of the page appearing.
 *   idle  — the bulk: 52 faces and the remaining cues. Wanted eventually,
 *           and worth nothing if it delays the board arriving.
 *
 * Each asset is warmed through the same kind of object that will later use it —
 * an `Image` for art, an `Audio` for sound — rather than through `fetch`. That
 * costs nothing extra (the second use is a cache hit, and for cues `sound.ts`
 * literally reuses the element) and it avoids betting on how a browser reconciles
 * a cached whole-file response with the range requests a media element makes.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* warmed: the music. It is nineteen megabytes across nine
 * tracks, only one of which will be heard first, and it streams perfectly well
 * on demand — precaching it would spend the entire bandwidth budget on the one
 * thing that least needs it. The room tone is the exception because it is a
 * single file that starts the instant the audio gate opens.
